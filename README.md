# Ending The Data Format Wars

## Viewing The Slides

The easiest way to view the slides is by [accessing the included PDF](./Ending%20The%20Data%20Format%20Wars%20-%20Carson%20Anderson.pdf), but you will not
get to run the examples locally.

## Running the Presentation Locally

By running the repo locally you will get a big play button in the top right corner of most slides
that allows you to test running the examples yourself.

You can start and run the presentation locally by cloning the repo and using the
included `run` script:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:carsonoid/talk-ending-the-data-format-wars.git
./run
```

Then just open http://127.0.0.1:3999/presentation.slide
